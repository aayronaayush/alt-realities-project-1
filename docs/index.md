For this project I decided to create a Museum exhibition space. Eventhough, this project sounds simple, it was challenging undertaking due to the recreation of the due complexities in lighting and arrangement of the pieces.

I decided to go for a more modern and minimalist look and feel for the museum. Two walls have paintings on them and the third wall has a geometric pattern that I feel will make a for great background for photos. A plant in the corner of the space gives the space a natural aura.

## Assets
The assets used in the project are a combination of assets from the Unity Asset Store, object created using the  probuilder tools.

Materials for the project were created using a colors and textures downloaded from google images.

Artworks used in the exhibition space were also created from scratch using probuilder cubes and images used has basemaps on the individual paints.
